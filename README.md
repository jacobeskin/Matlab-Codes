# Some-Matlab-Codes
Scripts written in Matlab, theme is more econometric models. Disclaimer: purpose of these scripts was to practice programming, using Matlab and becoming familiar with econometric models; the results and output of them are not guaranteed to be error free.

Function of each script is written inside the file as a comment. My native language is Finnish, and some of the variable names reflect this. I will be adding scripts here when I have time to translate the comments into English.
